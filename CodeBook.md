The variables for this dataset tidy.txt are the means and standard deviations from features.txt.  
They are grouped by subjectid and activity then averaged.


subjectid
    integers 1-30 denoting the 30 subjects

activity
    the 6 activities from activities_labels.txt
        WALKING
        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        SITTING
        STANDING
        LAYING

The averaged mean and standard deviation features from features.txt
